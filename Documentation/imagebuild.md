# Building the image

There are several ways to build the image but all do rely on the central git repository at

### Build on git

Simply login and start a build. You have to have an account to accomplish this. 

## Build locally

There are two ways to build locally.  Both require to download the build environment, though. The snippet below will download the "master" branch. If you want to access another branch please read the git documentation.

```bash
git clone https://gitli.stratum0.org/heyalter/heyalter-ubuntu-iso.git
cd heyalter-ubuntu-iso
```

You can run **./build-local.sh** directly or use Docker with **./dockerbuild.sh.**

### build-local.sh

If you want to run **build-local.sh** be aware that this has to be run on a plain vanilla Ubuntu image and it has to be the same you want to use as base image. 

The build process downloads the image, exports it and uses apt-get to download additional packages with the necessary prerequisites. As you know apt-get will only install/download dependencies that are not yet installed. 

### dockerbuild.sh

So it is much simpler to use **dockerbuild.sh** instead.  Running it the first time docker will be installed and the group docker will be added to the current userid. You have to logout/login to make it work, though. 

# File and directory structure

To be able to tinker with the build process you have to know the whereabouts. First all files involved directly for the build itself.
