## 2022-05-02

- Refactored the build process for faster debugging during the ISO development and removed obsolete stuff

### Added
- `guvcview` to test the webcam as a replacement for `cheese`
- Setup and Cleanup now have icons, as they needed to be converted to desktop files instead of bash scripts (see #34)

### Removed
- `cheese`, as it is currently bugged (see #39)
- `zoom-client`, as the snap doesn't work with Wayland and the problem is still unfixed since Ubuntu 21.10 (see #40)
  - The deb file from the official Zoom page works fine (but cannot be included, due to update problems)
- The 5.4 Kernel downgrade, as it is not possible anymore in Ubuntu 22.04 (and maybe not necessary anymore, see #36)

### Known Bugs

  - One solution may be to install the disk on another computer and then swap it back to the problematic computer
