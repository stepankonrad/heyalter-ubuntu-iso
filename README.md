## Installation procedure proposal

- [Installation procedure proposal {german}](install_proposal.md)

## Reenable the Welcome page on the first boot

After executing the Cleanup script, the computer will **once** open a welcome page when detecting a internet connection.
If this is unintentionally triggered while/after setting up the PC, you can reenable the welcome page with the following command:

```bash
systemctl enable --user heyalter.service
```

## Building the image

You can use Docker or run locally.

```bash
git clone https://gitli.stratum0.org/heyalter/heyalter-ubuntu-iso.git
cd heyalter-ubuntu-iso
docker run -it --rm -v "${PWD}":/heyalter -w "/heyalter" --name heyalter-iso ubuntu:jammy ./build-local.sh

OR simply

./build-local.sh
```

The finished build artifacts can be found inside the `artifacts` folder.

If you wish to debug a build, you might just start a docker container with the default bash and execute
`./build-local.sh` manually inside it. This allows you to inspect the intermediate files when a build error occurrs.
Furthermore you can manually execute the build steps by executing the appropriate script in the `scripts`-Folder, so
you don't need to start the build from scratch on little changes.
Execute the following command, instead of the above docker command:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}:/heyalter -w "/heyalter" --name heyalter-iso ubuntu:jammy
```
